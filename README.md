# PacSnake---No-Return
PacSnake – No Return is a grid-based arcade game built with Python and Arcade. Inspired by Pac-Man, but with a twist: every move leaves a fading trail that can kill you. Features classic chase/scatter ghost AI, power pellets, infinite wave scaling, precise tile-based movement, and neon-styled visuals.
